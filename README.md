# training-TRCS201
in this repository i will share what i have done on daily basis
the day started with introduction of linux 
it is a open and free source (not paid)
learned difference of linux over windows

downloaded mainly three softwares-

*1.virtual box*

*2.visual c++*

*3.ubuntu 24.04.02*
# DAY 2: 
We began the second day by quickly going over all the topics discussed on Day 1. This helped reinforce the concepts and set the tone for the new topics.

After the recap, we moved on to an important part of the operating system: the Kernel. The Kernel is the main part of an operating system, responsible for managing all critical resources such as memory, processor time, and input/output devices. It acts as the central unit that connects the system software to the hardware.

Following that, we explored the concept of the Shell. The Shell acts as a middle layer between the user and the Kernel. It receives commands from the user, interprets them, and then passes them to the Kernel to perform the requested operations.

Our teacher explained these concepts in a very clear and engaging manner, using a simple diagram to illustrate the flow of interaction:

# DAY3

We began by revisiting the concepts covered on the previous days to refresh our understanding. After the revision, we moved on to several new topics:

‚∏ª

üíª Dual Boot Setup

Dual booting allows a system to have two operating systems installed simultaneously. During startup, the user can choose which OS to boot into. This is particularly useful for switching between different environments (e.g., Windows and Linux).

‚∏ª

üìÄ Understanding ISO Files

An ISO file in Linux represents an exact copy of the data from an optical disk (like a CD or DVD) packaged in a single file using the ISO 9660 standard. It is commonly used for OS installation and software distribution.

‚∏ª

üîß Bare Metal Installation

This refers to installing an operating system directly onto a physical machine‚Äôs hardware, without the use of any virtualization technology. It‚Äôs often used for setting up servers or fresh systems from scratch.

‚∏ª

üñ• Virtualization: VMware vs VirtualBox
	‚Ä¢	VMware: A professional-grade virtualization solution, widely used in enterprises. Known for high performance, stability, and advanced features.
	‚Ä¢	VirtualBox: A free and open-source tool ideal for personal use, development, and testing. While it lacks some enterprise features, it‚Äôs easy to use and supports various operating systems.

‚∏ª

üíæ Disk Partitioning Schemes

Partitioning splits a hard drive into separate sections, each behaving like an independent disk. This helps in organizing data and running multiple OSes.

Main Types of Partitioning:
	‚Ä¢	MBR (Master Boot Record)
	‚Ä¢	Supports up to 4 primary partitions
	‚Ä¢	Maximum disk size: 2 TB
	‚Ä¢	Works with BIOS systems
	‚Ä¢	Considered outdated and less flexible
	‚Ä¢	GPT (GUID Partition Table)
	‚Ä¢	Supports over 128 partitions
	‚Ä¢	Can handle disks larger than 2 TB
	‚Ä¢	Designed for UEFI systems
	‚Ä¢	Offers better scalability and redundancy

‚∏ª

üîê Permissions and Shell Scripting

üî∏ File & Directory Permissions
	‚Ä¢	chmod (change mode): Used to set or modify permissions for files and folders.

Examples:
	‚Ä¢	chmod +x script.sh ‚Üí Grants execute permission to the script
	‚Ä¢	chmod 444 file.txt ‚Üí Sets file to read-only for all users
