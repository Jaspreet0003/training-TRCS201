# DAY 2: 
We began the second day by quickly going over all the topics discussed on Day 1. This helped reinforce the concepts and set the tone for the new topics.

After the recap, we moved on to an important part of the operating system: the Kernel. The Kernel is the main part of an operating system, responsible for managing all critical resources such as memory, processor time, and input/output devices. It acts as the central unit that connects the system software to the hardware.

Following that, we explored the concept of the Shell. The Shell acts as a middle layer between the user and the Kernel. It receives commands from the user, interprets them, and then passes them to the Kernel to perform the requested operations.

Our teacher explained these concepts in a very clear and engaging manner, using a simple diagram to illustrate the flow of interaction:
